## 🚨 Vulnerability Classification

| Severity     | Response Time | Example                    | Action                 |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **CRITICAL** | Immediate     | Exposed credentials, RCE   | STOP all work, fix now |
| **HIGH**     | < 24 hours    | SQL injection, auth bypass | Block deployment       |
| **MEDIUM**   | < 1 week      | Missing rate limit         | Schedule fix           |
| **LOW**      | Next sprint   | Minor info disclosure      | Backlog                |

## 🔍 Security Scan Patterns

### Check for Hardcoded Secrets

```bash
grep -rn "sk-" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
grep -rn "api_key" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
grep -rn "password.*=" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
```

### Check for SQL Injection

```bash
grep -rn "raw\|query\|execute" --include="*.ts" .
```

### Check for XSS

```bash
grep -rn "innerHTML\|dangerouslySetInnerHTML" --include="*.tsx" .
```

## 📊 Security Audit Report Format

```markdown
# Security Audit Report

## Audit Metadata

- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Scope**: [Files/Features audited]

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count |
| -------- | ----- |
| CRITICAL | 0     |
| HIGH     | 2     |
| MEDIUM   | 5     |
| LOW      | 3     |

## Findings

### [CRITICAL] Exposed API Key

**Location**: `src/config/api.ts:15`
**Description**: API key hardcoded in source
**Remediation**: Move to environment variable
**Status**: 🔴 REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION

---

**Report Status**: [APPROVED / REQUIRES FIXES]
```

---

## 🛡️ Security Response Protocol

When a vulnerability is found:

1. **CRITICAL** → Stop all work, fix immediately, rotate credentials
2. **HIGH** → Block deployment, fix within 24 hours
3. **MEDIUM** → Schedule fix in current sprint
4. **LOW** → Add to backlog
