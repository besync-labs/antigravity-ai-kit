## Core Skills

| Skill                   | Purpose                                       |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **verification-loop**   | Continuous quality gates (build, lint, test)  |
| **continuous-learning** | Pattern extraction from sessions (PAAL cycle) |
| **strategic-compact**   | Context window management                     |
| **eval-harness**        | Performance evaluation metrics                |

---

## Verification Loop

Runs all quality gates in sequence:

1. **Build Check** — TypeScript compilation
2. **Lint Check** — ESLint validation
3. **Test Suite** — Jest/Vitest tests
4. **Coverage** — 80% minimum threshold
5. **Security** — Dependency audit

```
/verify
```

## Continuous Learning (PAAL Cycle)

Extracts reusable patterns from sessions:

1. **P**attern — Identify recurring solution
2. **A**bstract — Generalize the pattern
3. **A**rchive — Store in knowledge base
4. **L**everage — Reuse in future sessions

---

## Strategic Compact

Manages context window efficiently:

- Preserves critical context
- Compacts routine information
- Maintains session coherence

---

## Eval Harness

Measures agent performance:

- Task completion rate
- Error frequency
- User satisfaction
- Response latency
