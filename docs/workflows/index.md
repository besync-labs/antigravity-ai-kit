# Workflows

Workflows are complete development lifecycles that guide you through multi-step processes. **11 workflows** for every development scenario.

## Workflow Lifecycle

Each workflow follows a structured lifecycle:

```
Initiation → Planning → Execution → Verification → Completion
```

1. **Initiation** — Workflow triggered via slash command
2. **Planning** — Requirements gathered, approach decided
3. **Execution** — Work performed with agent assistance
4. **Verification** — Quality gates ensure correctness
5. **Completion** — Results documented and committed

---

## Using Workflows

Invoke a workflow with its slash command:

```bash
# Start a brainstorming session
/brainstorm

# Create a new feature
/create Add user profile component

# Debug an issue
/debug API returns 500 error

# Deploy to production
/deploy
```

## Workflow vs Command

| Aspect       | Command            | Workflow             |
| :----------- | :----------------- | :------------------- |
| **Scope**    | Single operation   | Multi-step process   |
| **Duration** | Seconds to minutes | Minutes to hours     |
| **Output**   | Immediate result   | Documented artifacts |
| **Guidance** | Minimal            | Step-by-step         |
