## How Agents Work

1. **Delegation** — Main agent delegates to specialized agent
2. **Context Transfer** — Relevant context is passed
3. **Execution** — Agent performs focused task
4. **Report** — Results returned to main agent

## Using Agents

Agents are invoked automatically by commands:

```
/plan Add user authentication
# → Invokes Planner agent

/code-review src/auth/

```
